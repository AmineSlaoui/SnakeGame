# SnakeGame

## Project Overview

This project implements the classic Snake game using Python and the Pygame library. The game includes basic functionalities such as movement, food collection, and score tracking.

## Features

- Classic Snake Gameplay: Control the snake to collect food and grow longer. Game ends if the snake runs into itself or the walls
- Score Tracking: The score increases as the snake collects food.
- Deep Q-Learning: Train an AI agent to play the Snake game using reinforcement learning.
- Data Visualization: Plot and visualize data related to the game's performance and training progress.

## File Structure

- snake_game.py: The main script that setups the game and scoring system. It also deals with game logic and control
- deep_q_learning.py: Builds a single hidden layer neural network. Trains and optimize the network
- main.py: Entry point for the project, managing the setup and execution of the game and AI training.
- plot_graph.py: Generates a graph describing the performance of the snake overtime


## Prerequisite

- Python 3 version
- Pygame library
- TensorFlow library
